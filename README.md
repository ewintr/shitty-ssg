# My Shitty Static Site Generator

Although there are many SSG's out there that work perfectly fine, I still went through the effort of creating my own program to generate [my site](https://erikwinter.nl/). And after doing that I wrote a lot of text explaining why. As it turns out, there are some underlying motivations for creating your own tools that I think are interesting for non-programmers too. If you want to read more about it, check the [essay on my site](https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator/). There is also a [note on the markup used](https://erikwinter.nl/articles/2020/a-tiny-subset-of-asciidoc-for-blogging/). I will create some more documentation later.

But, one of the points to do it was to have the freedom to put my content anywhere I want. So I was able to bundle everything together and you can find de source files out of which the mentioned posts are generated right in this repository, in de `doc` folder.

As noted in the project name, this software is shitty. Don't use it. I put it here for inspiration and for educational purposes.
